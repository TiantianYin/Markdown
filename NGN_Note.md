# NGN Midterm Note
### Chapter 1
Two major concern:
  - how much it cost
  - how long will it take














You can `also`:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.


Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.


```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```
